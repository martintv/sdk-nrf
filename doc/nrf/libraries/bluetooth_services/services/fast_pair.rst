Google Fast Pair Service (GFPS)
###############################

   :depth: 2

The Google Fast Pair Service (Fast Pair for short) implements a BluetoothÂ® LE GATT Service required when :ref:`ug_bt_fast_pair`.

Service UUID
************

The Fast Pair service uses UUID of ``0xFE2C``.

Characteristics
***************

The Fast Pair GATT characteristics are described in detail in the `Fast Pair GATT Characteristics`_ documentation.
The implementaion available in the |NCS| follows these requirements.

.. note::
   The Additional Data characteristic is not supported yet.

Configuration
*************

Set the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_FAST_PAIR` to enable the module.

The following Kconfig options are also available for this module:

* :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_FAST_PAIR_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_KEY_MAX` - The option configures maximum number of stored Account Keys.
* :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_FAST_PAIR_CRYPTO_TINYCRYPT`, :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_FAST_PAIR_CRYPTO_MBEDTLS` - These options are used to select cryptographic backend for Fast Pair.
  MbedTLS is used by default, whereas Tinycrypt is used by default for cases of building with TF-M as the Secure Execution Environment (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BUILD_WITH_TFM`).
  This is because in such case the MbedTLS API cannot be directly used by the Fast Pair service.

See the Kconfig help for details.

Override of default Kconfig values
==================================

To simplify the configuration process, the GFPS modifies the default values of related Kconfig options to meet the Fast Pair requirements.
The service also enables some of the functionalities using Kconfig select statement.

Bluetooth privacy
-----------------

The service selects Bluetooth privacy (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_PRIVACY`) and sets the default value of :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_RPA_TIMEOUT` to 3600 seconds.

During not discoverable advertising, the Resolvable Private Address (RPA) rotation must be done together with the Fast Pair payload update.
Because of this, the RPA cannot be rotated by Zephyr in the background.

During discoverable advertising session, the Resolvable Private Address (RPA) rotation must not happen.
Therefore, consider the following points:

* Make sure that your advertising session is shorter than the value in the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_RPA_TIMEOUT` option.
* Call :c:func:`bt_le_oob_get_local` to trigger RPA rotation and reset the RPA timeout right before the start of advertising.

Bluetooth Security Manager Protocol (SMP)
-----------------------------------------

The service selects :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_SMP` and :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_SMP_APP_PAIRING_ACCEPT`.
The Fast Pair specification requires support for Bluetooth LE pairing.
During an ongoing Fast Pair procedure, peers using a normal Bluetooth LE bonding procedures are rejected by the service to prevent reporting invalid bonding capabilities.

Firmware Revision characteristic
--------------------------------

The Fast Pair specification requires enabling GATT Device Information Service and the Firmware Revision characteristic.
For this reason, the default values of :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_DIS` and :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_DIS_FW_REV`, respectively, are set to enabled.
The default value of :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_DIS_FW_REV_STR` is set to :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_MCUBOOT_IMAGE_VERSION` if :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BOOTLOADER_MCUBOOT` is enabled.
Otherwise, it is set to ``0.0.0+0``.

MTU configuration
-----------------

The Fast Pair specification suggests using ATT maximum transmission unit (MTU) value of ``83`` if possible.
Because of this requirement, the default values of the following Kconfig options are modified by the GFPS Kconfig:

* :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_L2CAP_TX_MTU`
* :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_BUF_ACL_TX_SIZE`
* :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_BUF_ACL_RX_SIZE`
* :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_CTLR_DATA_LENGTH_MAX`

.. tip::
   In case of :ref:`nRF53 Series <ug_nrf53>`, this part of the configuration cannot be automatically updated for the network core and you must manually align it.
   The listed options must be set on the network core to default values specified by the GFPS Kconfig options.

Partition Manager
-----------------

The Fast Pair provisioning data is preprogrammed to a dedicated flash memory partition.
The GFPS selects :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_PM_SINGLE_IMAGE` to enable the :ref:`partition_manager`.

Settings
--------

The GFPS uses Zephyr's :ref:`zephyr:settings_api` to store Account Keys.
Because of this, the GFPS selects :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_SETTINGS`.

Implementation details
**********************

The implementation uses :c:macro:`BT_GATT_SERVICE_DEFINE` to statically define and register the Fast Pair GATT service.
The Fast Pair service automatically handles all of the requests received from the Fast Pair Seeker.
No application input is required to handle the requests.

Bluetooth authentication
========================

The Fast Pair service overrides the set of Zephyr's Bluetooth authentication callbacks (:c:struct:`bt_conn_auth_cb`) while handling Key-Based Pairing request.
The callbacks are updated to report proper device capabilities for Bluetooth LE pairing request/response packets.
Overriding callbacks allows the GFPS to take over Bluetooth authentication during `Fast Pair Procedure`_ and perform all of the required operations without interacting with the application.
After the procedure is finished, the previously used callbacks are assigned back.

The Fast Pair Provider can still bond using a normal Bluetooth LE bonding procedures, without using Fast Pair.
The normal Bluetooth LE bonding procedure can be used, for example, if the connected Bluetooth Central does not support Fast Pair.
In that case, the bonding uses Bluetooth authentication callbacks registered by the application.

.. note::
   Zephyr supports only one set of Bluetooth authentication callbacks.
   Because of this limitation, it is not possible to simultaneously handle bonding using Fast Pair procedure and normal Bluetooth LE bonding.
   In that case improper device capabilities would be reported.

   Make sure that the normal Bluetooth LE bonding procedure and Fast Pair procedure do no overlap with each other.
   The recommended approach is to avoid handling more than one bonding procedure at a time.
